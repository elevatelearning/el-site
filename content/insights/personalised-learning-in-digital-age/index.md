Learning can take place anywhere, and at any time. The flexibility of learning experiences that we have become familiar with today, were distant dreams for instructors in the past. If you were to step into a learning environment in the past, what would you expect to see? Chances are you would find tables arranged in single-file rows and a teacher delivering the curriculum in the front of the room. Learners would have been required to simply absorb information without being **active participants** in their learning. Too many learners move through the curriculum regardless of whether they have mastered the required knowledge and skills. The modern world of learning is changing more rapidly than ever before, but there is a common golden thread amongst all these changes and developments: **digital learning has enabled learners to choose what, how and when they learn.** 

So, how exactly has technology and the rise of digital influenced the way learners learn and the way learning experts approach design?

# Learning Becomes Personalised

Technology and digital learning tools offer learning institutions and learning experts the opportunity to provide both variability of content and learning journeys, as well as advancing the practice of creating personalised learning experience.

The practice of personalised learning helps create what was once seen as a utopian educational dream: that learners would have access to a rich library of information and to an array of subject matter experts to help guide them throughout their learning experience.

# Key Indicators of Personalised Learning in the Digital Age

Before diving into the benefits of technology-driven personalised learning, let's explore a few of the key indicators of personalised learning in the digital age.

# Prioritising Technology in Learning Design

Utilising technology can elevate learning experiences. It can provide all stakeholders with valuable insight on learners' progress; and it can improve learner engagement as lessons become more interactive. For example, using classroom responsive systems (clickers) or software applications on devices allows learners to respond individually and simultaneously with immediate feedback. Learners also have access to experts and a rich library of information using research studies, scholarly databases, and reliable news sources etc. Furthermore, those who need to build on their organisational skills can rely on note-taking apps where reminders, prompts and strategies are provided. They also develop their logic, critical thinking and communication when learning to design, build and assess their own apps, robots, and games. Educators can easily connect with all learners and parents through virtual office hours, class webpages or even online gradebooks. More importantly, learning can happen with anyone, anywhere and at any time.

To take full advantage of educational technology and to help move your learning experience forward into the digital age, prioritise these four key principles:

Create a learning environment where learners feel like they can take ownership over their education, set their own goals and plan ways to achieve success. Encourage learners to work collaboratively with their peers, to think critically and solve problems. When learning is learner-centred, a contextualised and personalised curriculum is created. As a result, learners gain a deeper understanding of themselves as they engage in meaningful tasks. 

There are several digital tools designed to support learners as they progress at their own pace and academic level. For example, [different forms of media](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED607620.pdf) could be used to share knowledge by means of text, video, audio, or virtual field trips to name a few. Learners are also given opportunities to be creative and demonstrate their mastery of the content taught (e.g., learner presentations, 3D printed models or even a music video). 

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/elevatelearning/image/upload/c_scale,w_750/v1659012392/site-articles/personalised-learning-in-the-digital-age/Personalised_Learning_-_Blog_Article_1_uxdyco.png" alt="This graphic illustrates the concept that educators or learning instructors should be properly equipped." title="Educators or Learning Instructors Must Be Properly Equipped" class="img-center"/>

Many smart technologies already offer the user with customised and personalised experiences such as allowing learners to record their own voices, customise their own avatar, add their pictures to create digital stories or to simply adjust display setting to meet their specific needs. Many educators do not feel that they have the competencies to use digital tools effectively, let alone adapt personalised learning practices in their classrooms. It is vital that professional learning opportunities be made available to assist educators to move towards this new approach to learning. They will become leaders and innovators in education by collaborating and developing solutions and instruction. As [technology is constantly improving and evolving](https://nmcdn.io/e186d21f8c7946a19faed23c3da2f0da/0a143ac0adb340a3b12bfea12da96a52/files/reports/personalized_learning_brief_final_003_1.pdf), educators should be equipped to explore and test new ideas and practices.

Digital content is more interactive, easily accessible, and easily updated. When combining digital content and assessments, skilled educators gain insight from real-life data and can immediately assist learners with learning barriers while extending others who excel. Educators will base their decisions on data, making learning and instruction more personalised than ever before.

When personally creating or selecting free or fee-based digital content or assessments, certain qualities should not be overlooked. The content should contain clear graphics and images. Learners should be able to interact with the content easily and move at their own pace. They should also follow their own learning pathway based on their level of mastery in embedded assessments and interaction with the software. These assessments could contain fill-in-the-blank queries or multiple-choice questions. Interactive skills-based assessments could also be incorporated as well as opportunities for learner reflection. The data gained from the assessments and interface features should provide the educator with all the information relating to the learner’s capabilities and needs. Digital activities and assessments should also be [evaluated](https://www.iste.org/explore/education-leadership/11-qualities-good-digital-content) to ensure that learners are not over stimulated or become overwhelmed (cognitive overload).

This seems like a tall order. Unfortunately, new teaching and learning strategies will not be sustainable without the proper infrastructure. Our perception and approach to education needs to change and move beyond urban contexts to create a shared digital world, providing all learners with the opportunity to experience and benefit from personalised digital learning. 

# The Benefits of Technology-Driven Personalised Learning

The one size fits all learning models does not prepare our learners for a successful future. Personalised learning has been revitalised as educators utilise technology and digital tools to connect, engage, and teach their learners with even greater success. With all the benefits noted, it is important that the recommended four key principles are prioritised to move education forward into the digital age and to make personalised digital learning a reality for all.
