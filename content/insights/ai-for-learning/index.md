### "﻿AI is the ultimate democratiser, providing access to information, education, and economic opportunity on an unprecedented scale." —﻿ Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft

If you’ve logged onto LinkedIn recently, there’s no doubt that your feed has been flooded with posts and musings related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). And while it’s not a new phenomenon, artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT have been flooding the social media airwaves, raising some interesting questions about how we acquire, process and share information. 

The future of learning design (and education as a whole) is shaped by changes and advancements in digital technology. As learning design specialists, we’re encouraged to stay on top of current trends related to learning, and the impact that certain advancements could have on the way we design learning for the future. But, what if these trends and upcoming advancements posed a threat to not only how we design learning, but to our roles within learning design?

# T﻿he Changing Role of Learning Designers

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/elevatelearning/image/upload/c_scale,w_850/v1675067194/site-articles/ai-for-learning/banner_2.2-06_1_csqjqv.png" alt="Decorative image" title="Decorative image" class="img-center"/>

As experts in learning and development, we play a crucial role in guiding learners on their journey of knowledge acquisition and competency development. But the way we approach this task is evolving. Gone are the days of rigidly scheduled classroom sessions or solely relying on information shared via a company-wide learning management system. In today’s information age and knowledge economy, learners expect to access knowledge on their terms and at their own pace. 

As learning designers, our goal should be to tap into the innate curiosity and drive for self-knowledge that our learners mimic behaviourally when they use other digital platforms. By designing experiences that foster a state of flow, we can truly engage learners and inspire them to take ownership of their learning. And by embracing technology (and its innovations), we can elevate our designs and become true facilitators of a holistic and fulfilling learning experience. 

But this means adopting a strategic approach to learning and development, rather than a purely operational one. In the past, we’ve been overly reactive, rather than pre-emptive of our teams’ learning needs, and overly rigid in prescribing specific learning content in response to those needs. This shift in skillset comes with a required shift in mindset, and more specifically, being open to technological advancements, rather than fearful of them. 

As learning designers, we need to be at the forefront of technological advances. This is to grow our love for learning, sympathise with our learners, and so that we can use these as tools to develop faster and more relevant learning experiences for our learners. At Elevate, we believe that technology is a powerful tool for creating personalised and impactful learning experiences. However, too often we (as an industry) rely on technology alone to shape our learning strategy (or try to ignore them altogether in the fear that they’ll ‘take over our jobs’). Instead, technology should be utilised as an enabler, allowing us to integrate and enhance our approach to learning.

## S﻿o, What Does AI Mean for the Future of Learning?

And, why should you care? If this is all hype, surely the conversation will eventually fizzle out?

[According to JD Dillon, founder of LearnGeek](https://www.learngeek.co/innovation/), it’s time to pay attention to AI. His research shows that it’s no longer just hype — it’s becoming a reality. Instead of resisting it, we should explore how we can leverage AI to our advantage and stay ahead of the curve.

A well-designed learning experience is characterised by its personalisation to the individual learner. To achieve this, it is essential for learning designers to continually evaluate and incorporate learner data into their designs. This iterative process allows for more effective and efficient delivery of instruction, ultimately leading to enhanced learning outcomes.

So, how does AI help revolutionise the tedious process of synthesising and analysing copious amounts of learner data? For many learning experts, this list should be familiar, but perhaps their tracking and data analytics capabilities were never fully explored in light of the recent popularity of the likes of ChatGPT.

**Here is a list of AI tools to consider when conducting monitoring and review processes:**

# E﻿mbracing New Technical Advancements (With Some Caution)

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/elevatelearning/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1674722681/site-articles/ai-for-learning/banner_02-05_zi06lb.png" alt="Decorative image" title="Decorative image" class="img-left"/>

With all of these tools and advancement, this begs the question what is the point of writing anything ourselves as learning designers and how do we help our students use their developing judgment to utilise AI in ethical ways? Is there even a place for AI in academia? 

As the occurrence and use of AI become more mainstream, we will need to continue to figure out how much we allow AI to work for us and we will have to become more clued up on AI plagiarism. Thankfully, almost as quickly as new technology is developed, some counter-actions help us to integrate new tech into the real world. Apps like GPT Zero and GPT Detector have been created to detect where AI generators like Chat GPT have been used.

So how could we use AI in learning? At Elevate, we believe that we should embrace new technologies and teach our learners how to be critical thinkers. We should encourage them to use new technologies but teach them how to evaluate what bots produce. 

This issue calls all the more for collaborative teaching styles. The teaching process needs to be more cyclical and iterative. With more review and revision steps in assessment, a teacher or facilitator should be able to point out the errors of AI “thinking” and show where the learner should have critiqued AI output. We will need more continuous coaching and facilitation rather than one-sided lecturing and single-summary assessments.

It means we need to start curating and personalising content and placing it at a point of need. It means making multiple premium content libraries accessible to everyone, and giving learners free reign to learn what they want to, when they want to. And it means designing and implementing intelligent search functionality into those systems.

And this requires a multidisciplinary set of skills. 

It’s time to unlock the full potential of AI in learning! While it may not be the end-all solution, it can certainly help streamline tedious tasks and allow learning designers and educators to focus on what they do best. Embrace the power of AI and make it a regular part of your workflow. Remember, the more this technology is used and improved upon, the more future benefits we’ll reap. It’s time to welcome AI into the future of learning.
