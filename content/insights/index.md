Long before the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals across the world were using social media as a tool to create community, to foster collaboration, and to broadcast information for consumption. Social media has become an intrinsic part of daily life, with [studies](https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media#post-navigation-1) claiming that users spend an average of 2 hours and 24 minutes a day on different platforms. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, pockets of society have become increasingly dependent on social media as a means of information gathering and a means of forging and strengthening collaborative spaces.

## **The Role of Social Media Tactics in eLearning**

By its very nature, the digital world is continually developing, growing and adapting. The social media platforms which occupy this space equally adapt to meet its users' changing demands and needs. However, one use of social media remains unchanged: social networking.

A practice of collaborating and communicating with like-minded individuals in an online environment. These platforms can also be used to build and develop relationships between people, and often assist in fostering a sense of community. 

Social learning is a key motivating factor for many in-person learning experiences. The growing demand to take learning online whilst ensuring that the social needs of learners are met has left many scratching their heads as to how to achieve this. But it's the same platforms we've long been using to engage with others online that can also be utilised as a cooperative learning tool.

####  **What does 'cooperative learning' mean?**

As a strategy, cooperative learning focuses on structuring learning around collaboration between learners. The aim of cooperative learning is to set up a learning environment in such a way that the success of each learner is dependent on the performance of the group as a whole. 

With [more than half the world's population](https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media#post-navigation-1) having some sort of social media account, it is increasingly becoming evident that institutions seeking to disseminate learning material, have not only a wide audience base, but one that is ready to consume information online.
