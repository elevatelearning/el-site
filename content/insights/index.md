title: Social Media as a Cooperative Learning Tool

Long before the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals across the world were using social media as a tool to create community, to foster collaboration, and to broadcast information for consumption. Social media has become an intrinsic part of daily life, with [studies](https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media#post-navigation-1) claiming that users spend an average of 2 hours and 24 minutes a day on different platforms. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, pockets of society have become increasingly dependent on social media as a means of information gathering and a means of forging and strengthening collaborative spaces.

## **The Role of Social Media Tactics in eLearning**

By its very nature, the digital world is continually developing, growing and adapting. The social media platforms which occupy this space equally adapt to meet its users' changing demands and needs. However, one use of social media remains unchanged: social networking. 

#### \[Image] **What does 'social networking' mean?**

A practice of collaborating and communicating with like-minded individuals in an online environment. These platforms can also be used to build and develop relationships between people, and often assist in fostering a sense of community. 

Social learning is a key motivating factor for many in-person learning experiences. The growing demand to take learning online whilst ensuring that the social needs of learners are met has left many scratching their heads as to how to achieve this. But it's the same platforms we've long been using to engage with others online that can also be utilised as a cooperative learning tool. 

#### **\[Image] What does 'cooperative learning' mean?**

As a strategy, cooperative learning focuses on structuring learning around collaboration between learners. The aim of cooperative learning is to set up a learning environment in such a way that the success of each learner is dependent on the performance of the group as a whole. 

With [more than half the world's population](https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media#post-navigation-1) having some sort of social media account, it is increasingly becoming evident that institutions seeking to disseminate learning material, have not only a wide audience base, but one that is ready to consume information online. 

So, how can we start to shift our perceptions of social media away from simply documenting lifestyles and selling products or services, to one that positions social media as a platform for collaborative and cooperative learning?

## **The Importance of Harnessing Social Media as a Learning Tool**

[Your learners' digital footprint](https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/teach-learn-share-the-role-of-social-media-in-elearning) is present now more than ever. Access to information is now more readily available at a simple click of a button, which leaves learners hungry to learn more, instantly. 

In 2021, [Hamadi, El-Den, Azam and Sriratanaviriyakul](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S1319157820305838?token=4CEDB185A2C055894B77F192A3FBA4958C72CCD13CBA05707D9ACE9DE9C2EBCCC60FD9692350AB23AB754E2AF240F050&originRegion=eu-west-1&originCreation=20220506051647) published a framework for integrating social media as a cooperation learning tool — assessing the pedagogical benefits of social media platforms and tactics. This valuable research was conducted with higher education in mind, but could potentially be applied to other learning contexts too. 

If implemented carefully, the use of social media in the learning process could enhance users' collaboration, communication, and engagement. These learning platforms could allow for in-class learning and offline activities — simultaneously addressing users' needs and learning goals. 

Their proposed framework is made up of five levels which are following sequentially:

This framework identifies valuable considerations for any learning environment or design: 

1. The correct pedagogical approach must be carefully selected (in this instance, we’re focusing on cooperative learning as an effective approach). 
2. Common challenges and fears surrounding the use of social media must not be ignored, and should rather be factored into both the design and implementation of a learning plan. 
3. After selecting your pedagogical approach, identifying key challenges, and designing a solution to mitigate these concerns, you can begin to implement your learning plan. This may look different based on the nature of delivery – whether you’re online or in-person – but regardless, your learners should feel empowered and motivated by this plan. 
4. Finally, after you have delivered this plan learning, take time to properly evaluate the success (or failings) of this plan. Engage directly with learners and seek out feedback.

While the purpose of this article is not to describe the five levels of the original work, it is of importance to explore some of the key points from this framework as they align with various social media tactics and platforms within the eLearning space.
